# SDKWork Settings

repository-kind: application

SDKWork Settings — configuration center providing multi-tenant, multi-user, multi-language configuration management with multi-architecture integration support.

## What This Is

A configuration center that lets different SDKWork applications (PC, H5, Flutter, mini program, native Android/iOS/Harmony, backend services) integrate settings, preferences, and tenant config through a unified API and SDK surface instead of each application reimplementing its own settings layer.
